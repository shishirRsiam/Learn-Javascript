    <h1>What is DOM?</h1>
    <p id="dom-introduction">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform, language-independent interface that
        represents an HTML or
        XML
        document as a tree structure. This structure is made up of nodes, which are related to each other in a
        hierarchical
        structure. Each node has a parent node, and can have zero, one, or more child nodes. Nodes at the same level
        that depend
        on the same parent node are called sister nodes. The entire DOM tree depends on a main node called the Document
        node. </p>
    <div id="dom-list">
        <h5> In HTML DOM, every element is a node, including: </h5>
        <li> Document node: The entire document </li>
        <li>Element node: All HTML elements</li>
        <li>Attribute node: All HTML attributes</li>
        <li>Text node: Text inserted into HTML elements</li>
        <li>Comment node: Comments</li>
        <!-- <br> -->
    </div>

    <p id="dom-details">The DOM allows developers to access and change different parts of a web page, such as headings,
        paragraphs,
        images, and
        forms. It also connects web pages to scripts or programming languages, allowing them to interact with the page
        and
        modify it. For example, a scripting language like JavaScript can be used to modify the DOM.</p>
